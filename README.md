# Ariel University OOP course
## Ex1 - Undirected Weighted graph implementation, with the functions:
	1. Deep copy
	2. Check if the graph is connected
	3. Shortest path (length of the path and the path itself) - by Dijkstra algorithm
	Language: Java.
## File list:
	1. node_info (Interface)
	2. NodeInfo (Implementation)
	3. weighted_graph (Interface)
	4. WGraph_DS (Implementation)
	5. weighted_graph_algorithm (Interface)
	6. WGraph_Algo (Implementation)
## Description
	All collections inside the classes are Hashmaps, contains each "node_info" and its unique key.
	The connected functions relays on DFS algorithm, the shortest path algorithm relays on Dijkstra.
## Project Status
	Look forward for next exercises.
